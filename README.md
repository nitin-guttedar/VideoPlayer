# WebView & Push Notifications Demo ðŸ””

A modern mobile application built with **React Native** and **Expo** that showcases robust integration of advanced mobile features: **deep-linking push notifications**, an **embedded WebView**, and a **custom HLS video player**.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Push Notifications:**
  - Schedules local push notifications using `expo-notifications`.
  - Notifications are also scheduled based on app events, such as when the WebView finishes loading.
- **Embedded WebView (`react-native-webview`):**
  - Displays live web content (e.g., Flipkart) within a dedicated card on the **Home Screen**.
  - Includes a custom **loading overlay** and spinner that appears while content is being fetched.
- **Custom HLS Video Player:**
  - A dedicated screen utilizing **`expo-av`** to play HLS streams (`.m3u8` format).
  - Features a **fully customized control overlay** (Play/Pause, Forward/Rewind 10s, Mute/Unmute, Fullscreen toggle, and time display).
- **Modern Themed UI:** Utilizes **`expo-linear-gradient`** for engaging backgrounds and a consistent color palette defined in `src/constants/colors.js`.
